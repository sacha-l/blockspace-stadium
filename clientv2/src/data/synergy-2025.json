This privacy layer prevents awkward workplace dynamics where spending habits or financial situations might be judged. Similarly, in a vacation rental split among friends, 0xCC allows different people to contribute varying amounts based on room preferences without creating social tension over who paid what. Unlike traditional apps like Venmo or Splitwise where payment amounts and history are visible, 0xCC uses zero-knowledge proofs to verify payments without revealing individual contribution details, making it perfect for maintaining financial privacy in social and professional settings.",
